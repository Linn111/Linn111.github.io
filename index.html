        		<h1>Welcome to Seminal Books</h1>
				<p>Seminal Books publishes books and articles from a small collection of authors.  These books are usually offered in small volumes as POD (print-on-demand)
        using POD publishers such as Kindle Direct, IngramSpark or Lulu.  Our intent is to make and market unique, quality books for nitch targeted markets.  Our 
        strategy is start small, meet the author's needs with the minimum fuss and get books in print.  When sales reach a "tipping point" the books publishing can 
        migrate as appropriate to larger, or more target-appropriate traditional publishers.
        
        Curently we have two target markets: 1) Swedish and Swedish-American genealogy and history and 2) Mental illness from patient's perspective, and three Authors 
        and books coming in both markets.
